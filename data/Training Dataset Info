The dataset used to build this model is an open-source breast lesion ultasound dataset, containing ultrasound scans (images), as well as one or multiple masks (ground truth masks) for each and every image.
This dataset can be found in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) website via this link : https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/breast-lesions-usg/. 
However, since this dataset contains multiple masks for some images, the multiple masks (ie. casenumber_other1.png, casenumber_other2.png, casenumber_other3.png, and casenumber_other4.png) had to be removed from the dataset for simplicity purposes.
The newly curated dataset can be found at this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16hZbKotB_fjsvG79W_iFMuyvGLBbJFLt?usp=drive_link
Futhermore, since nnU-Net was used in this study, the name of the images and masks had to be changed from ie case001.png to BT_001.nii.gz for the images and for the masks, from case001_tumor.png to BT_001_0000.nii.gz
